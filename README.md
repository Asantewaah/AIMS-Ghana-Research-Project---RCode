 1. all_simulation.Rmd
 • Description: Contains comprehensive simulation code to assess the performance of various estimators (Difference-in-Means,
Ordinary Least Squares, Inverse Propensity Weighting, OSE, and TMLE) across different sample sizes and confounding scenarios.
 3. unconfounded_simulation.Rmd
 • Description: Focuses on the initial simulations to evaluate traditional estimators (Difference-in-Means and Ordinary Least Squares).
Includes data generation, model fitting, and performance metrics.
 5. real_data.Rmd
 • Description: Analyzes real data from the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study, applying multiple estimators to estimate the average treatment effect
and calculate confidence intervals. Covers data preprocessing, model fitting, and result interpretation.
 7. confounded_simulation.Rmd
 • Description: Includes additional simulations to compare semi-parametric estimators (OSE and TMLE) with traditional methods under more complex conditions.
Refines the unconfounded simulations with advanced scenarios.
